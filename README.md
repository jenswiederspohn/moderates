## Abstract
Do Americans hold substantively moderate policy preferences, or does apparent moderation reflect the limits of contemporary survey-based measurement? Using panel data from the 2020--2024 Cooperative Election Study, this paper evaluates whether ideological centrality corresponds to coherent and stable policy positions. I estimate a hierarchical dynamic latent-variable model that separates global ideological placement from heterogeneity, instability, idiosyncrasy, and unsystematic responding. The results replicate the familiar finding that many respondents appear ideologically central, but show that centrality alone rarely corresponds to substantively moderate preference structures. Instead, apparent moderation reflects multiple underlying processes, and estimates of a moderate electorate depend critically on how coherence and stability are defined. These findings caution against inferring widespread policy centrism from one-dimensional or classification-based summaries and clarify the measurement conditions under which claims about moderation are empirically warranted.
